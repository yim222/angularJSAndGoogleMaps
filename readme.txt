Hi!

This is a draft of Client – side webApp (that built on Mock Data) implementing UI with angularJS, and Google-Maps API. 
In this Video you can see how I am running the program.

You probably will need a valid Google-Maps API – since Google change their restriction to GM API’s. 

After running its on server go to this URL (Assuming that you work on localhost8080) : 

http://localhost:8080/Margoling-Project/trying10/app/
and the other features: 

http://localhost:8080/Margoling-Project/trying10/app/ready2-keywords.html
http://localhost:8080/Margoling-Project/trying10/app/ready2-vla.html
http://localhost:8080/Margoling-Project/trying10/app/ready2-posts.html
http://localhost:8080/Margoling-Project/trying10/app/ready2-targetDetails.html
